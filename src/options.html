	<h1> The key options will regard syncronization with ColorPick extension (history etc) </h1>
	
	basically one option.... added colors are added to ColorPick Extension history (enabled default) <br/>
	
	Second option (sub option) - full history loaded from ColorPick extension (up to 8192 history colors) <br/>
		(disabling this, the extension may maintain it's own history) <br/>

	EXT will maintain it's own pallete and all other settings... the one may be overridden though since ColorPick Extension history MAY be full source of truth. <br/>

	<h1> options isolated to this extension (possiblity of) </h1>

	navigate as soon as the snapshot is ready

	<h1> random todo </h1>

	obviously this page <br/>

	console logs /errors cleanup everywhere <br/>

	em - would settings work except we never write them???  SDL_APP_WILLENTERBACKGROUND never... 
		consider how we deal with multi instance though, if at all...  <br/>

	<h1> out there ideas </h1>

	once the user moves the pixel in the EM view... we move the pixel in the main EXT view (as long as its still open)
			which theoretically lets them use the new view to manipulate color input fields?
